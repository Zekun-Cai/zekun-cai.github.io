I am a postdoctoral researcher at the **University of Tokyo**. I obtained my Ph.D. in 2024 from the [Center for Spatial Information Science](https://www.csis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/) at the University of Tokyo, where I was supervised by [Prof. Ryosuke Shibasaki](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0UjOE4IAAAAJ) and [Prof. Xuan Song](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_qCSLpMAAAAJ). Additionally, I conducted a research visit at **Emory University** from 2023. Prior to that, I received my M.S. from the University of Tokyo in 2021 and my B.S. from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in 2018.

During my Ph.D., I was fortunate to be co-advised by [Prof. Renhe Jiang](https://www.renhejiang.com/) at UTokyo and collaborated with [Prof. Liang Zhao](https://cs.emory.edu/~lzhao41/) at Emory University. My work centered on developing principled approaches for **temporal domain generalization** under continuously evolving data distributions. In parallel with my academic research, I also collaborated with industry partners such as **Tencent** and **Yahoo! JAPAN**, focusing on analyzing, modeling, and predicting **trillion-scale human behavioral data** in real-world environments.

I have published over 20 peer-reviewed papers in venues including NeurIPS, KDD, TKDE, TMC, and CIKM, and I regularly serve as a PC member for conferences such as NeurIPS, KDD, IJCAI, and CIKM.

### Research Interests

My recent research focuses on developing mathematically and physically grounded approaches to enhance the adaptability and generalization of AI systems in complex environments. Key areas include:

- **Continuous Domain Generalization**: Synchronizing evolution of data and neural networks through Structured Representations, Manifold Geometry, Group Equivariant, Neural Differential Equations, etc.
- **Spatiotemporal Learning at Scale**: Graph Neural Network, Spatiotemporal Foundation Models, Dynamic Representation Learning, Real-world Applications, etc.
